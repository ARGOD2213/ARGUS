# ARGODREIGN Mobile Chat Space

User note preserved:
- `hi this is just for a test if you can see this give me reply in codex`

This is your online browser space to continue work from phone.

Important:
- The exact Codex desktop chat thread is not available on mobile.
- This file is the live handoff bridge between desktop work and mobile updates.
- This page itself is not a chat box. It is a document.

## Why You Cannot Type Here

GitHub file view is read-only by default.

To type from phone, use one of these:
1. Tap the pencil icon (`Edit`) on this file, add your note, and commit.
2. Open or create a GitHub Issue and type comments there (best for chat-like updates).
3. Keep using this Codex thread when desktop is available.

## How to Use From Phone

1. Open this file in GitHub mobile browser/app.
2. Read `Latest Update` first.
3. Copy the `Reviewer Prompt` section if you need external review.
4. Run START/STOP workflows from GitHub Actions as usual.
5. Come back here for next actions.

## Async Office Mode (No Desktop Needed)

1. Open reviewer issue template:
   - `https://github.com/ARGOD2213/ARGODGEIGN/issues/new?template=reviewer-drop.yml`
2. Paste reviewer output and submit.
3. Wait for action `Review Inbox Sync` to finish.
4. Open:
   - `docs/REVIEW_INBOX.md`
5. Run workflow:
   - `Trigger Codex Execution`
   - optional `issue_number`
6. Send Codex:
   - `Process docs/REVIEW_INBOX.md and implement all P1 then P2 fixes. Commit and push.`
7. If sync does not update in 2 minutes:
   - Run workflow `Review Inbox Sync` manually from Actions.
   - Pass `issue_number` if needed.

## Latest Update (IST)

- Processed current synced review issue `#2`:
  - Added interactive chart upgrades on all dashboards:
    - `machine.html`: alert severity doughnut chart
    - `safety.html`: risk mix + NH3 zone share charts
    - `plant.html`: status mix + zone risk charts
    - `compliance.html`: compliance component + inspection status charts
- Added one-click trigger workflow:
  - `.github/workflows/trigger-codex-execution.yml`
  - queue files:
    - `docs/CODEX_TRIGGER_QUEUE.md`
    - `docs/CODEX_TRIGGER_LATEST.md`
- Auto-sync trigger hardened:
  - Works for normal `Review` issue titles too.
  - Added manual Action run fallback (`Review Inbox Sync` with `issue_number`).
- Review inbox currently tracks latest issue from sync workflow.
- Sprint 1: Closed.
- Sprint 2 progress in repo: machine, safety, plant, compliance dashboards added.
- LLM confidence, advisory wrapper, and day-by-day evidence files are committed.
- Remaining work should now follow reviewer checkpoint feedback and integration hardening.
- Copy-paste packet for reviewer is available at:
  - `docs/REVIEWER_COPY_PACKET.md`

## Reviewer Prompt (Copy/Paste)

Use this with your reviewer:

```text
Please audit the latest ARGODREIGN master branch for Sprint 2 progress.
Focus on:
1) Dashboard functionality: /machine.html, /safety.html, /plant.html, /compliance.html
2) AI governance: AiAdvisoryWrapper present and confidence is computed (not hardcoded)
3) Safety architecture: rule engine remains Lambda-only (no control logic in Spring Boot)
4) Cost guardrails: budget + cache + no expensive always-on services
5) Evidence docs under /docs for Day 7/9/11/12/13/14

Return:
- PASS/FAIL by checkpoint
- exact gaps with file paths and line references
- only actionable fixes in priority order (P1 -> P3)
```
